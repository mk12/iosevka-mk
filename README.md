# Iosevka MK

Iosevka MK is my custom version of the [Iosevka font][1].

## Usage

First, install the dependencies with `make deps`. This assumes you are on macOS and have [Homebrew][2] installed.

Then, run `make` to build the fonts and place them in the ttf/ folder. This can take a long time, so be patient.
